Make WordPress migration easy. Migrate your database at the click of a button with full support for serialized data.

== Description ==

WP Migrate DB takes the hassle out of moving your WordPress site.

https://deliciousbrains.wistia.com/medias/vahu041lkd

WP Migrate DB is a WordPress migration plugin that makes exporting and migrating your database easy, fast, and straightforward.

Each migration takes shape in the form of an easy to follow three-step process.

1. Find and replace the data you want directly within the WP Migrate DB interface.
2. Export the SQL.
3. Import into your new database using a tool such as phpMyAdmin

Simple, right? We believe that WordPress database migration doesn't have to be overly technical or opaque. Instead, WP Migrate DB was created with the sole aim of making WordPress site migration easy.

WP Migrate DB fully supports serialized data and arrays and can find and replace content within serialized arrays. What does this mean for you? It means it's far easier to migrate your database, and there's no risk of data corruption.

WP Migrate DB  handles serialized data by unserializing the data and going through it, identifying strings and running a find & replace on them. Once it has gone through all the data, it serializes it again and sticks it back in the database.

Example: <code>s:5:"hello"</code> becomes <code>s:11:"hello world"</code>

You're also able to run in-place find and replace, which lets you find and replace on the current database (without migration).

== Frequently Asked Questions  ==

= Do I have to set up my WordPress migration manually each time? =

No! WP Migrate DB includes what are called "Migration profiles." These profiles allow you to save your WordPress migration settings to make the process as fast as possible.

= Is WP Migrate DB compatible with WordPress multisite? =

The free version of WP Migrate DB is compatible with WordPress Multisite, however, if you [upgrade to Pro](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/upgrade/?utm_campaign=WP%2BMigrate%2BDB%2BPro%2BUpgrade&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting), the power is turned up to 11. Pro includes full support for importing a single site into a Multisite network, and you can also export a subsite into a single site.

= I have a ton of spam comments on my site, can I exclude those from the migration? =

You sure can! WP Migrate DB allows you to exclude spam comments from any WordPress migration in a click.

= What if a plugin corrupts my WordPress migration? =

Don't worry! Since WP Migrate DB 1.0 and above, all plugins are put into compatibility mode, which essentially prevents them from loading for migration requests only.

Plugins can be whitelisted to run while the migration is running from a straightforward to use admin interface.

= Can I migrate my entire WordPress website with this? =

Yes! Just purchase the Developer license or better, and you'll be able to push and pull your media, plugins, and themes in addition to your database in a couple of clicks.

= Question: What format is my WordPress database exported in? =

When you run the migration, your WordPress database is export in SQL, you then save the file to your desktop and can import that via another database tool such as phpMyAdmin.

= I've always been told exporting my WordPress database is difficult, what makes this different? =

WP Migrate DB comes with everything you need and nothing you don't. With a friendly, easy-to-use user interface, being able to export WordPress database files reliably has never been easier.

= Can I use WP Migrate DB to move to new web hosting? =

Yup! You can easily export your database and import your database into your new web hosting account using a tool like phpMyAdmin or similar. Want even more power? [Upgrade to Pro](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/upgrade/?utm_campaign=WP%2BMigrate%2BDB%2BPro%2BUpgrade&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting) and simply push or pull all your media and theme/plugin files as well.

= What exactly does push/pull databases mean? =

If you're using a staging website and have a live website hosted somewhere else (like a good developer who follows best practices) then you'll make updates locally and then make those changes live.

However, your database will be out of sync between the two, at some point you'll be missing important data!

[WP Migrate DB Pro makes this easy](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/upgrade/?utm_campaign=WP%2BMigrate%2BDB%2BPro%2BUpgrade&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting). You can pull a database from live to staging, make your changes, and then push back to the live site with a click. Remember, though, this functionality is only available in WP Migrate DB Pro.

= What about serialized data? Will my data remain intact? =

WP Migrate DB fully supports the finding and replacement of serialized data. Simply input the data you want to find, and the data you want to replace it with and let WP Migrate DB handle the rest.

= Will you migrate my WordPress website for me? =

We don't offer WordPress migration services at this time, but you might want to give [WP Migrate DB Pro](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/upgrade/?utm_campaign=WP%2BMigrate%2BDB%2BPro%2BUpgrade&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting) a try. It's a WordPress migration plugin with everything you need to migrate to a new host quickly and easily. And if you find it too difficult, we have a 100% No-Risk 60-Day Money Back Guarantee so you can easily get a refund.

= Can I use the command line (WP-CLI)? =

Yes, WP Migrate DB includes an `export` and `find-replace` command. With the [WP Migrate DB Pro Developer license](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/upgrade/?utm_campaign=WP%2BMigrate%2BDB%2BPro%2BUpgrade&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting) or better you get the CLI addon which includes an additional six commands: `push`, `pull`, `profiles`, `profile`, `setting`, and `import`. Check out [our documentation](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/doc/wp-cli-command/?utm_campaign=support%2Bdocs&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting) for more information on our WP-CLI commands.

= Can I migrate to a new domain? =

WP Migrate DB is perfect for migrating to a new domain! You can use the built-in find and replace functionality to find your old site URL (domain name) in your database content and replace it with your new one.

= What are the steps to migrate my site with WP Migrate DB? =

Assuming you're using the free version, simply install the plugin. Fill in the URL(s) you'd like found and what to replace them with, and export your WordPress database, which will download an SQL file. Now access your MySQL (or MariaDB!) database using your preferred tool (like phpMyAdmin or SequelPro), import the SQL file, and you're good to go.

= Why is WP Migrate DB better than Updraft, Duplicator, and Search Replace DB? =

Ok, so maybe we're biased, but if you've used other tools, you'll know they can be complex to set up, and challenging to use. Not to mention, they may not work every time.

Let's look at a popular find and replace script for serialized data called Search Replace DB, with this you have to upload the script, run it manually and it doesn't have a backup option or email support.

A quick comparison with Updraft Plusâ€”while Updraft Plus provides a lot of functionality, it's primarily a backup plugin with a premium option for migrating your website. Compare that to WP Migrate DB -- the site migration tool used and recommended by professional WordPress developers.

*The Themes and Plugins add-on for WP Migrate DB Pro from @dliciousbrains is pure genius. So many use cases I didn't think of when they released it. Mainly: 1) Staging sites 2) Plugin support Saves me time every week.* - Clifton Griffin, Development Lead at Objectiv

Finally, Duplicator is a migration plugin that does things very differently from WP Migrate DB. Duplicator creates a zip file of your database and files that must be manually transferred (via FTP/SFTP) to your site's new location. This package must then be unzipped and an installer script run. These operations are all much more taxing on server resources than what WP Migrate DB does and lot less smooth than WP Migrate DB Pro.

= Can I clone WordPress, or duplicate WordPress using WP Migrate DB? =

You can! While cloning a WordPress site can be difficult, WP Migrate DB makes it a breeze. The same goes if you want to duplicate WordPress, which is a different way of saying the same thing. Here's a quick step by step guide.

**Step 1:** Install the plugin on the WordPress install you want to clone WordPress to.
**Step 2:** Fill in the find and replace fields within WP Migrate DB.
**Step 3:** Export the database.
**Step 4:** Import the database into your new site.

And it's as simple as that, your data has been cloned onto the new site, ready to go. Pssst¦ If you have [WP Migrate DB Pro](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/upgrade/?utm_campaign=WP%2BMigrate%2BDB%2BPro%2BUpgrade&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting), it's even easier to clone your entire website, including all your media, themes, and plugins.

= Is FTP a thing of the past? =

If you use [WP Migrate DB Pro](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/upgrade/?utm_campaign=WP%2BMigrate%2BDB%2BPro%2BUpgrade&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting), no longer do you need to use those old clunky FTP clients. Instead, you can push and pull your plugin, theme, and media files in a click. It couldn't be simpler.

= Will this work with my hosting provider? =

WP Migrate DB works perfectly with all web hosting providers and even your localhost install! It's never been easier to migrate your website to a new server, update your domain, or make changes between local and staging.

= How about backing up my database? =

[WP Migrate DB Pro](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/upgrade/?utm_campaign=WP%2BMigrate%2BDB%2BPro%2BUpgrade&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting) performs a database backup before exporting your SQL. However, if you're using WP Migrate DB free, we'd recommend using a plugin or making backups through your web hosting control panel before migrating your site.

= What support is provided? =

Limited free support is provided, and we offer dedicated priority email support for our WP Migrate DB Pro users.

= Where can I find out about the pricing of WP Migrate DB Pro? =
